# Pre Work Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This website is used to keep notes on topics learned in bootcamp. I was motivated to make this website because others like me need a way to keep their notes. This website makes reading on bootcamp easier. Through this project, I learned how to use HTML, Git, Javascript, and CSS together.
